  "summary": "Implemented a new Trip History panel and added a Trip History entry to the mobile sidebar menu. Updated Auto Toll logic in CarExpensesPanel to auto-add a single Toll expense for the current weekday only and avoid duplicates. However, the diff evidence is truncated, so some required navigation/UI elements (desktop/in-app menu placement and Total trips display) cannot be fully verified. Additionally, there are signs of unrelated changes (e.g., default date range and weekend-counting logic) not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "Mobile sidebar menu clearly includes Trip History, but the diff for the main (non-mobile) in-app navigation/tabs is truncated, so it’s not verifiable that Trip History is accessible from the primary ledger menu/navigation on desktop.",

      "reason": "TripHistoryPanel computes totalTrips, but the file content is truncated before showing the footer/total display; cannot confirm it is rendered at the bottom and matches the required presentation.",

      "reason": "CarExpensesPanel now includes logic to auto-add only for today, but the diff is truncated and does not show removal/absence of any previous bulk-add behavior tied to dateRange changes; cannot confirm switching date range no longer bulk-creates entries.",

There are also multiple ledger/UI/styling changes that are not requested by the BuildRequest and may be scope creep.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the frontend config module required by the auth/actor hooks (imported as '../config') is present and cannot crash the app at runtime; provide safe defaults and handle missing/invalid environment/config values gracefully (II URL, derivation origin, canister/agent config).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows no added/modified config module (e.g., frontend/src/config.ts) or any code explicitly handling missing/invalid environment/config values. The only related note is an unverified description that AuthGate was 'simplified to avoid config dependencies', but no concrete config module implementation is shown.",

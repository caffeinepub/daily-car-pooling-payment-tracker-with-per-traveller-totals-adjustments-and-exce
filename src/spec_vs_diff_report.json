  "summary": "Implemented current-month default date range via ledger local state, added date range utilities (current month/full month/full year/classification), and introduced an Overall Month/Year selector component wired to shared ledger dateRange. However, based on the truncated diff summary, some acceptance criteria (Clear Data reset behavior and Trips & Payment tab defaulting behavior) cannot be fully verified.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Using \"Clear Data\" / clear-all behavior resets the date range to the current month (not the current week).",
      "reason": "The diff shows the default date range changed to current month in local state, but there is no visible (non-truncated) evidence that the Clear Data / clear-all flow resets the dateRange to current month.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/useLedgerLocalState.ts (shows default date range only)",
        "frontend/src/features/ledger/LedgerPage.tsx (truncated; ClearDataPanel integration not verifiable)"

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Existing behavior for Trips & Payment tabs continues to default to a full-year range when first entering those tabs, unless explicitly changed by the user.",
      "reason": "LedgerPage.tsx introduces separate date-range buckets and imports getFullYearRange and TRIPS_PAYMENT_TABS, but the relevant tab-switching initialization logic is truncated, so the full-year default on first entry cannot be confirmed from the provided excerpt.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/features/ledger/LedgerPage.tsx (truncated; shows TRIPS_PAYMENT_TABS and getFullYearRange import but not the full tab-change logic)"

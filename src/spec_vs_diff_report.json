  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses both requirements. REQ-1 is implemented in App.tsx with weekday checking, existing toll detection, and once-per-day enforcement via lastAutoTollDate tracking. REQ-2 is implemented via a new MultiCategoryExpenseForm component that creates 3 expense entries with pre-selected categories (Toll, CNG BRD, CNG AHM) and independent amount/date inputs.",

      "description": "Added a separate 'Add 3 Expenses' button in CarExpensesPanel alongside the single expense form",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only specified modifying 'the add expense popup', not creating a separate multi-expense button/dialog. The requirement suggested enhancing the existing popup, not adding a parallel workflow.",

      "reason": "While lastAutoTollDate tracking is necessary for implementation, exposing it in the UI or settings was not requested. The constraint explicitly states to preserve existing auto-toll settings functionality without specifying new settings fields.",
